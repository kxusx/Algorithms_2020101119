Main Ideas

- Countability and Computability
- Computability of Problems

### Countability and Computability

**Countability**

- 2 kinds of set : Countable and Uncountable
- A Set is countable if we can map a bijection from the set of natural numbers to the

    set in question. eg: {0,1}*

- If we can't translate a bijection from the set of natural numbers to the set in

    question, the set is uncountable. Proof is through cantor diagonalization

**Computability**

- Computers cannot solve all computational issues.
- We can prove through : computational issues >>>>computer applications.

**Computer Problems are Uncountable**

- A membership inquiry problem can be stated as a computer problem.
- Language is a subset of all potential inputs. Example: Any subset of {0,1}*.

**Computer Programs are Countable**

- Cardinality(Computational Problems) = Cardinality(( {0,1}* )) = Countable
- As long as the axioms of computing stand, no futuristic computer will be able to compute these non-computable problems.

Therefore, 

The number of programs is countable and an uncountable number of problems.

computational issues >>>>computer applications.
