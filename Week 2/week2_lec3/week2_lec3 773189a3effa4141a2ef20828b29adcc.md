## Nomenclature of Problems

1. Tractable - Any problem that is solvable by a polynomial-time algorithm.

                          Upper Bound : Polynomial in nature

2. Intractable - Any problem that cannot be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm.

                              Lower Bound : Exponential in nature

## Problems

### Calculating the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci Number $F_n$

**1.Recursion Algorithm**

Fibonacci number $n$  is calculated using:  $F_N = F_{N-1} + F_{N-2}$  

Time Complexity : T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) : Exponential

The problem: WAP to take $N$ and give $F_N$

**2.Memoization Algorithm**

This significantly lowers the complexity of time and space. 

Time Complexity : $O(n^2)$

```coffeescript
int fib(int n) {
     int f[n + 2];
     int i;
     f[0] = 0;
     f[1] = 1;
     for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
     {
         f[i] = f[i - 1] + f[i - 2];
     }
     return f[n];
 }
```

**3.Using Matrix Multiplication**

Time Complexity : $O(M(n)logn)$[M(n) is the time taken for n bit matrix multiplication]

**4.Direct Formula**

Time Complexity: $O(n log^2 n)$.

Problem in this method is that precision is very low.

Even if precise storage of 5 is achievable, it will still have to be raised to the nth power, which is worse than method 3.

### Algorithms For Multiplying Large Integers

### Traditional Method

Integers are expressed in binary form and multiplied directly with repeated addition.

**Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$**

### Karatsuba Algorithm

The Karatsuba algorithm is a rapid multiplication method that uses the divide and conquer paradigm to multiply two n-digit integers.

Multiplying two complex no.s

$(a+ib)(c+id) = (ac - bd) + i(ad+bc)$

This operation naively takes four multiplications namely: $ac, bd, ad, bc$

Instead we can:

- Compute $ac$
- Compute $bd$
- Compute $(a + b)(c + d)$

and then obtain $(ad + bc) = (a + b)(c + d) − ac − bd$

So two multiply two n-bit integers $x$ and y, partition each of them into parts that contain $n/2$  of the bits each i.e. 

$x = 2^{n/2}a + b$

$y = 2^{n/2}c + d$

therefore 

 $x\cdot y = (2^{n/2}a + b) \cdot (2^{n/2}c + d)$ 

Which is similar to the above method of computing complex products but instead of $i$we have $2^{n/2}$

Time Complexity: $O(nlog_2^3) = O(n^{1.585})$

**Algorithms with better complexities than** *O*(*n*1.585)

1. Fast Fourier Transform - $*O(n ∗ logn ∗ log(logn))*$
2. Faster - $*O(n ∗ logn ∗ 2O(log∗n))*$
3. Fastest - $O(nlogn)$
