**Main Ideas**

- Edit Distance

## Edit Distance

Problem : Two strings $A$  of length $m$ and $B$ of length $n$. Transform $A$ into $B$ with minimum number of operations. The operations are: 

1. Delete a character from $A$.

2. Insert a character into $A$.

3. Change some character in $A$ into a new character.

The Edit Distance between two strings is the minimal number of operations required to convert one string to the other.

**Dynamic Programming Solution**

We can use dynamic programming to solve this.

**Input:** Two text strings  $A$ of length  $m$ and $B$ of length $n$. 

Before going to a solution, let us consider the possible operations for converting $A$ into $B$. 

1. If $m>n,$ we need to remove some characters of $A$.

2. If $m==n$, we need to convert some characters of $A$.

3. If $m<n$, we need to insert some characters in $A$.

We generate the recursive formulation of the problem. 

Let, $T(i,j)$represents the minimum cost required to transform first  $$  $i$ characters of $A$ to first $j$ characters of $B$. That means, $A[1 ... i] to B[1 ... j]$ $T(i,j) = min(1+T(i-1,j);1 + T(i,j-1); T(i-1,j-1)+diff(i,j))$

$diff(i,j)$ is 0 if the characters are equal and 1 otherwise

We have the following cases

- If we insert $i^{th}$ character in $A$, then convert these $i$ characters of $A$ to  $j$ characters of  $B.$
- If we delete $i^{th}$  character from $A$, then we have to convert remaining 
$i-1$ characters of $A$ to $j$ characters of $B$.
- If $A[i]==B[j]$, then we have to convert the remaining $i-1$ characters of $A$  to $j-1$ characters of  $B.$
- If $A[i] \ne B[j]$, then we have to replace $i^{th}$ character of $A$ to $j^{th}$ character of $B$  and convert remaining $i-1$ characters of $A$  to $j-1$ characters of $B$.

### Subproblems :
